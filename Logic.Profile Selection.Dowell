After Shuffling and quality check of shuffling, a perfect random series of profiles will be obtained.
The finalised series is best random arrangement of total eligible profiles(say N).
From those 'N' profiles, sample of size (say n) will be selected each day for further evaluation.
Since the profiles are arranged randomly so first 'n' profiles will get selected for first day.
Those selected 'n' profiles will not be replaced, another day selection will be from rest (N-n) profiles.
In the similar way each day 'n' profiles will be selected without replacement for a week.
Each profile will be selected only once in a week.
